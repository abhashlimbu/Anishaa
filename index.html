         <p>
            Happy birthday, my friend! Today is a special day, and I wanted to
            take a moment to wish you all the best on this milestone. We've come
            a long way since our college days in class 11, and I wanted you to
            know how much your friendship has meant to me. Our time together in
            the college holds a special place in my heart. Since our college
            days are over, life has taken us on separate paths, and we don't get
            to see each other as often. But please know that our friendship
            remains as strong as ever. The memories we created together are
            timeless, and I cherish the bond we share. On your birthday, I want
            you to know how much I appreciate you. You've always been there for
            me, offering support, inspiration, and a genuine friendship. Your
            kindness, intelligence, and warm-hearted nature have left a lasting
            impact on me.
         </p>

            As you enter this new chapter of your life, I wish you nothing but
            success, happiness, and fulfillment. May your dreams and aspirations
            come to fruition, and may every step you take be filled with
            excitement and joy. Remember that you have my support and
            friendship, no matter where life takes us. Happy birthday, my
            friend. Enjoy your special day to the fullest and create wonderful
            memories. Thank you for being an amazing person and for being a part
            of my life. Warmest wishes and a heartfelt happy birthday.
